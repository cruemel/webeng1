Checklist for Identifying Web Apps

Is it mostly self-contained, without redirecting me to a completely different experience to complete what I set out to do?

Can I interact, engage and accomplish something by using the application?
    
Does it have a rich user interface that looks nice, and takes advantage of the full size of the window available to it?

If you answered yes to most of these questions, then what you're looking at is most likely a web application.

Does it use the same paradigms as native applications for buttons, dialogs and other components?
    
Does it work offline?
    
Is it using the capabilities of the device itâ€™s running on, for example location data through the GPS and motion sensors?
   
Are traditional website navigation elements and links hidden from view?
    
Is the app designed around a primarily client-side architecture model?
